Kira Plastinina- Customer Behavior Analysis

# Background
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

# Defining the Question
Can we identify a single most important demographic from within our client's target audience, for her to target with her advertising?

# Metric for Success
Our metric for success will be succesfully comparing each feature to each other feature.

# Experimental Design Choice
All our research will be centered around whether or not a certain demographic or sub-group of the population click on ads or not. We will compare that against city, income, time spent on site and age.

We will also study different correlation indices to see which ones negatively and positively affect the likelihood to click on ads.

# Is the data appropriate enough to answer our question?
Yes it is, considering our design choices. We can do our analysis and give our enterpreneur client a satisfactory answer.
